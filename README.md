[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b654c94e-08a6-4b79-b443-7837581b1d8d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/heuristic-brown-9dc575/deploys)


Simple search app that consumes [PokeAPi] and displays basic information about Pokemon created with React JS + Typescript 


![Pokedex Preview](./src/assets/images/pokedex.jpg)



### Tech

The stack I used: 

* [ReactJS] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces 
* [Typescript] - Typed JavaScript at any scale
* [Tailwindcss] - A utility-first CSS framework for
rapidly building custom designs
* [Twin.Macro] - Use tailwind classes within jss-in-css libraries
* [Styled] - Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress


### Installation

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd pokedex
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
